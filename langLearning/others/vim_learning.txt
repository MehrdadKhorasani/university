motions:
h = right	j = down	k = up		l = left
12h = 12 letter to right & ...
w = next word	b = previous word	e = end of the word 
0 = move to the start of the line

$ -> end of line
^ -> start of the line
. -> repeat the last command
d+^ -> delete from current char to end of line (and tons of example with key combining)

% (shift + 5) = jump to end or start of (,{,[,...

i = insert mode
a = insert mode on the following char (append)
shift+a = insert mode after last char of line
escape || ctrl+[ || ctrl+c = command mode
v = visual mode 	shift+v = visual mode with new line if you copy!
v+i+t = select content in inter tag
v+a+t = select content in outter tag
v + > or < = tab a certain content (also works without visual mode)
after v mode => :sort => sort the selected line alphabetically

if you want to implement a command in more than one line:
	1. v for visual mode - select the lines you want
	2. :
	3. normal "your command" => :normal A;
	WOW

yy = copy a line in command mode
yw = copy a word in command mode
yl/y = copy current letter in command mode
p = paste on below line
P = paste on above line

yanking and deleteing is going to the same buffer, 
	so if you type p after delete a line, the deleted line pasted
	or if you paste a line above a line, the next paste going to be the line that over-writed
	
i = insert mode
o = inter a new line below and insert mode
O = inter a new line above and insert mode
x = delete the current character
X = delete a character backward
r = replace the current character
dl = delete a letter
dw = delete a word
dd = delete a line (3dd => delete the folowing three lines).
d% = delete from current position to end of the line
d^ = delete from current position to start of the line
J = join the current line with next line
u = undo
U = undo the changes in line
CTRL-R = undo the undo
ctrl+r = redo
d+2+j = delete two line below

:wq

gg = go to the top of the file
G = go to the bottom of the file
G => Go to line => 10G == go to tenth line of code

Search Mode (/ or ?):
if you hit "/" while you are in command mode,
it found the word comes after /,
with "n" (next) you can found other similar words
capital "N" finds the previous similar words

:split example.txt == sp example.txt = split the screen horizontally 
:vsplit example.txt == vs example.txt = split the screen vertically
ctrl+ww = switch between screens
ctrl+w+arrow keys = switch between screens

buffers {
vim file1.c file2.c file3.c

:ls => list of buffers
:bn => jump to next buffer
:bp => jump to previous buffer
:b1 => jump to first buffer
:b file1 => jump to buffer that named file1
:bd => delete current buffer
:bd! => delete current buffer by force!
}

:s/a/b = find the first "a" letter in file and replace it with "b"
:s/a/b/g = replace all the "a" letters with "b" in current line
:18,37s/a/b/g = replace all the "a" letters with "b" in lines between 18 to 37
:%s/a/b/g = replace all the a with b in the entire file 
:18,22s/^/\/\/ = comment the code between 18s line and 22s line.

ctrl+g: shows the current location in the file and the file status
ctrl+o: go back to where you came from != ctrl+i: goes forward
